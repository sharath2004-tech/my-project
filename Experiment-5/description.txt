The page is an HTML document with a <head> and <body>.

The title of the page is "Product Filter".

Thereâ€™s a heading <h2> that says "Product List".

A <select> dropdown menu allows users to choose a category.

The dropdown has 4 options: All, Clothing, Electronics, Books.

A <div> with id="products" displays the product list.

An array items holds objects with name (product name) and cat (category).

Products include T-Shirt, Jeans, Headphones, Smartphone, Novel, Cookbook.

The function showList(cat) controls which products are shown.

productsDiv.innerHTML = '' clears the product display before showing new items.

forEach() loops through all products in the items array.

If cat is "all" or matches the product category, a new <div> is created for that product.

The created product <div> has inline styles: border, margin, padding.

The dropdown triggers showList() with the chosen category when changed (addEventListener).

showList('all') runs on page load, showing all products first.
