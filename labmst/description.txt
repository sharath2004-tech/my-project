The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
It displays a list of students, where each student has an ID, name, and age.
Each student is shown in a card format for clear and attractive presentation.
The cards are styled with colors and rounded corners to look modern and friendly.
There is an input form at the top of the page to add new students to the list.
Users can enter a name and age, then click the button to add a new student.
The student list updates instantly when a new student is added.
The whole project layout is centered on the screen for a neat appearance.
The student cards and list have background colors to make them stand out.
The project is easy to use and helps practice basic React concepts like state, forms, and lists.
