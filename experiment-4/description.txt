I built a Live Character Counter project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal of this project was to create a simple tool that shows the number of characters typed in real time.

This feature is useful in places like forms, social media posts, and comment sections where character limits are common.

I started by writing the HTML structure.

I added a textarea where users can type their text.

I created a space below the textarea to display the live character count.

After that, I used CSS styling to make the design clear and user-friendly.

The layout was kept simple so that users could easily focus on typing.

Styling helped improve readability and overall appearance.

Next, I added functionality with JavaScript.

I wrote code that listens when a user types, deletes, or pastes text.

The counter updates instantly to reflect the current number of characters.

This project demonstrates my understanding of basic web development.

It shows how HTML builds structure, CSS improves design, and JavaScript adds interactivity.

The Live Character Counter is lightweight, practical, and can be used in many real applications.
