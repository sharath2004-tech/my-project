The page uses HTML5 with a <canvas> for drawing.
The title of the page is "Simple Drawing".
A <style> block adds a black border to the canvas and centers content.
The <canvas> element has id="canvas" with width 500px and height 300px.
Thereâ€™s a heading <h2> titled "Draw with Mouse".
A Clear button calls the clearCanvas() function.
JavaScript gets the canvas element using getElementById().
ctx = canvas.getContext('2d') enables 2D drawing.
A boolean drawing tracks whether the mouse is pressed.
on mouse down starts a new path and moves the pen to mouse position.
on mouse move draws lines while the mouse is pressed.
on mouse up stops drawing when the mouse button is released.
on mouse out also stops drawing when the cursor leaves the canvas.
clearCanvas() erases everything using clearRect().
The pen is styled with a black color, round edges, and thickness of 2 pixels.
